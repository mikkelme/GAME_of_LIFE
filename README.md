# Game of life (GUI)

This is a small hobby based project where I implemented a Game of life graphical user interface (GUI) as a way of getting familiar with some the functionalities of matplotlib.widgets.

## Use 

To try out the GUI simply run 

``` 
python GAME_of_LIFE.py

```
to start the GUI, and the following should appear. 


<p align="center">
    <img src="startup_view.png"
         alt=""
         style="width:80%">
    <h5 align="left"> 
    Caption 
    </h5>
</p>

To start a game use the features a explained in the following. 

|  Actions | Functionality | 
|---|:---:|
| Click on the squares | Toggles cell on/off (black/white) |
| Click the **Random** button| Generates a random configuration with probability $p$ of getting an cell on (black) ... to the percentage level to the right (default is 20 \%) | 
| Click on the *SYM* button| |
