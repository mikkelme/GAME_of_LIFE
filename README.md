# Game of life (GUI)

This is a small hobby based project where I implemented a Game of life graphical user interface (GUI) as a way of getting familiar with some the functionalities of matplotlib.widgets.

## Use 

To try out the GUI simply run 

``` 
python GAME_of_LIFE.py

```
to start the GUI, and the following should appear. 


<p align="center">
    <img src="startup_view.png"
         alt=""
         style="width:80%">
    <h5 align="left"> 
    Caption 
    </h5>
</p>

To start a game use the features a explained in the following. 

|  Actions | Functionality | 
|---|:---|
| Click on the squares. | Toggles cell on/off (black/white). |
| Enter number: 0-100 \%, in the percentage text field. | Sets the probability for a cell to be on when generating random configurations (default is 20 \%).|
| Click the **Random** button. | Generates a random configuration of uniform distribution corresponding to the set probability. | 
| Click on the **SYM** button.| Generates a random configuration of uniform distribution for half the grid corresponding to the set probability and mirrors it to the other half through the vertical centerline.|
